I used a package called packcircles to generate the circle packing, which I found though a circle-packing-with-R guide and plotly to make the graph interactive. The latter package is most important given the variation in size from the most to least frequent owner roles, as it allows the user to zoom in to see the least frequent roles while maintaining the visual difference in frequency among owner roles I wanted to show.\n\nCodeoq_freq &lt;- companies %&gt;%\n  select(company_size, owner_qualification) %&gt;%\n  group_by(owner_qualification) %&gt;%\n  summarize(cnt = n()) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(cnt))\n\npacking &lt;- circleProgressiveLayout(oq_freq$cnt, sizetype = \"area\")\noq_freq &lt;- cbind(oq_freq, packing)\ndat.gg &lt;- circleLayoutVertices(packing, npoints=50)\n\np &lt;- ggplot() + \n  geom_polygon(\n    data = dat.gg,\n    aes(x, y, group = id, fill = as.factor(id),\n        text = paste(\n          \"Qualification:\", oq_freq$owner_qualification[id],\n          \"&lt;br&gt;Count:\", oq_freq$cnt[id]\n        )),\n    color = \"black\",\n    alpha = 0.6\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = viridis(nrow(oq_freq))) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = subset(oq_freq, cnt &gt; quantile(cnt, 0.6)),\n    aes(x, y, label = owner_qualification),\n    size = 3.5\n  ) +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  labs(title=\"Most Common Roles for Brazilian Business Owners\") + \n  coord_equal()\n\nggplotly(p, tooltip = \"text\")",
